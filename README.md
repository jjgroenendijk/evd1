# Using GitLab

If you're not familiar with using GitLab, you can simply download this repository as a ZIP archive. The downside is that you will have to check this repository for updates manually on a regular interval and merge changes by hand.<br />
If you would like to get started with GitLab, refer to the following [instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html).<br />
<br />
As a reminder, here is a list of git command line commands that are often used:

* Clone via HTTPS (only the first time)<br />
  <code>git clone https://gitlab.com/hugoarends/evdk5-2425.git</code>
* Receive changes from GitLab.com<br />
  <code>git pull origin master</code>

For people also submitting changes, here are some additional useful commands:

* Verify local changes<br />
  <code>git status</code>
* Verify which files and folders are ignored<br />
  <code>git status --ignored</code>
* Prepare local changes before committing<br />
  <code>git add \<file-name OR folder-name\></code><br />
  <code>git add \<file-name OR folder-name\></code>
* Undo an add operation<br />
  <code>git reset \<file-name OR folder-name\></code></code>
* Commit local changes<br />
  <code>git commit -m "COMMENT TO DESCRIBE THE INTENTION OF THE COMMIT"</code>
* Send changes to GitLab.com<br />
  <code>git push origin master</code>
